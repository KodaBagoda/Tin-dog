## TinDog: Swipe Right for Love (and Wags)

**TinDog** is a fun, fictional web application inspired by Tinder, designed specifically to connect dog owners with other canine companions (and their humans) in their area! This project was built as part of Angela Yu's Web Development Course.

This project uses:

- **HTML:** The building blocks of web pages.
- **CSS:** Styles the HTML to create a visually appealing interface.
- **Bootstrap (optional):** A popular front-end framework that can help with layout and responsiveness.

**Features (may vary depending on project implementation):**

- Browse profiles of adorable dogs near you.
- Swipe right on pups that catch your eye (and your pup's!).
- View a dog's bio, including breed, hobbies (fetching?), and temperament.
- (Optional) Chat with other dog owners to arrange playdates or walks.
